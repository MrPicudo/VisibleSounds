# VisibleSounds

## WWDC23 Swift Student Challenge Submission

Imagine a hidden world, filled with patterns and geometric shapes, concealed within every sound we hear. Have you ever wondered what it would be like to visualize this world? Introducing the innovative app, "__VisibleSounds__," which will take you on a journey through the fascinating science of __Cymatics__, where you'll discover how sound vibrations give life to beautiful and mysterious figures on metallic surfaces.

The essence of "__VisibleSounds__" is based on the analysis of more than __600 images__. It should be mentioned that a lot of time and effort was invested to create 17 stunning animations using for loops, allowing users to observe and understand how these figures are formed with different sound __frequencies__. Each animation reveals a magical world hidden within the __sounds__ surrounding us.

Upon launching the app, "__VisibleSounds__" will guide you through an introduction to Cymatics, explaining its fundamentals and presenting you with a particular image formed by a __frequency__ of 345 Hertz. Next, you are invited to explore a list of 17 unique figures, each created from different __frequencies__ ranging between 300 and 5000 Hertz. This visual tour will allow you to appreciate the diversity and beauty of the shapes generated by __sound__.

In addition to the visual experience, "__VisibleSounds__" demonstrates how __sounds__ are intimately related to our __feelings__, and that one of the reasons for this is that they are much more than that; each sound hides a geometry that has been seen by few people but has been felt by __billions__. This connection between sounds and emotions allows users to better understand how sound can influence their daily lives and emotional well-being.

"__VisibleSounds__" also challenges you to test your acquired knowledge through an __interactive quiz__. In this game, you are presented with the image of a final figure and four __frequency__ options. The challenge is to identify the correct frequency that gives rise to the displayed figure. This playful and educational approach makes the experience even more engaging and memorable for users.

Upon completing the quiz, the app reveals your score and challenges you to achieve a perfect score. "__VisibleSounds__" not only offers a unique and entertaining visual experience but also teaches you about the science behind these patterns and how the __sounds__ we hear can shape our world in surprising ways. The app is designed to open your eyes to a universe of hidden wonders and inspire you to explore beyond what you can see and hear. Get ready to delve into the mysterious world of Cymatics with "__VisibleSounds__"!
